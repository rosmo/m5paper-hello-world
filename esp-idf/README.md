# Hello World on M5Paper with ESP IDF 

components/m5epd is the repository at https://github.com/m5stack/M5EPD with an additional CMakeLists.txt file (borrowed from: )

One change was made to m5epd/src/utility/GT911/GT911.cpp by changing `ICACHE_RAM_ATTR` to `IRAM_ATTR` and removing the interrupt disable/enable. 

The dependencies are managed via ESP-IDF Component Manager.
